# Coherence in Chalk Paper

The title of the paper has not been finalized.

To build the paper:

```
$ make
```

This will generate the file `coherence-in-chalk.pdf`.

To clean up the build artifacts (not the PDFs):

```
$ make clean
```

All files for sections of the paper must be listed after the
`coherence-in-chalk.pdf:` target in the Makefile.
